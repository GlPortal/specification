# Workflow for creating the Score
## Score Specification
Write down the outline of the score.
## Track Specification
Split the outline into several tracks and write detailed information about each track.
## Musical Notes (optional but recommended)
Write down the notes for the track using one of the [editors](http://www.lilypond.org/easier-editing.html). Save the resulting lilypond file and commit it to github.
## Interpretation
Create your track in ogg format and submit it to the raw data repository.
## Re-Iteration
Present the results to a test audience and use the feedback to improve the piece.

# Additional Information

Depending on what levels will be created, different ambiences will be used, calm or... less calm.
Each level will have colored tiles setting the mood, and blinking according to what's being played as background music.

## Recommended Tools

You may use whatever tools you are used to work with, but if possible use free and open source music composing applications if you don't find yourself limited by them.

## Exporting and publishing

Gather all the following and send it

* directly using `git` to the [glportal_raw_data](https://github.com/GlPortal/glportal_raw_data) repository
* or to one of the team members who will put it on the repo for you

### Rendered audio / interpretation

Export the music in one of the following formats:

* **Lossless**: WAV, FLAC
* **Lossy**, *high bitrate or quality*: OGG (Vorbis), (OGG) Opus

### Visual Tracks

It is possible that we need track data in MIDI format. Don't bother with advanced settings or even assigning instruments to each track, this MIDI file is merely used for the creation of musical visual feedback.

### License

You are free to chose the license for the files you created, as long as you allow the music to be redistributed along with GlPortal. This is the minimum requirement.
Also bear in mind people may want to use your works for other projects or want to remix it. Ideally choose a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/choose/) like CC BY-SA (Attribution, Share Alike) which is a [Free Culture](http://creativecommons.org/freeworks) one, to allow this.

# TODO
## Music trackers
MOD format, etc...
