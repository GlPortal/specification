# Reality Shift
Reality Shift is intended as a simple level that can easily be extended just by stringing
more rooms at the end of it. The idea is to have a demo level for the game where new features
can easily be tested and show cased. As a positive side effect of the design obsolete rooms
that connect other rooms can be removed easily.

The level forms a tunnel and is just a string of different maps connected to each other.
Most rooms have a very similar layout but all present their own very unique challenge.
So it feels more like traversing parallel dimensions of the same rooms over and over
again instead of moving through physical space.

Following elements could be interesting:
- increasingly harder platforming
- acid pits as a consequence to missed jumps
- platforms dissapear into a wall
- platforms swoop the player off of platforms
- slow projectiles that keep the player moving
- platforms that crush the player from above
- safe points will give the player a sense of fairness (they safe room and position)
